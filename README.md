# Server-Buster

#Read Me Contents

This read me mainly covers the installation process of Serv-B, and on that end there isn't very much to say.

#Requirements

1) Have node and npm installed on your machine.
   if (noNodeInstalled)
       download node and npm here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
       follow installation instructions
       and you're done!
2) Enter the backend folder
3) run npm install
4) you should have all deps of the project installed like mongo, express, and etc
5) run node server.js in the first level of the backend directory.
6) The app is up and running. If your console generates an error address in use type message,
   then the TCP port of the app, 8080, is in use. Free up the port via a command or change 
   the app's port number which can be found in config.js inside the Config folder.
